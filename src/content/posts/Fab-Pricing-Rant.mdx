SCGCON Portland Cost to Play Rant
The air wasn’t the only thing that was cold in Portland that day. 
I sit at the end of a row of unused convention hall tables. Wrappers and crumbs texturing my despair. I am splitting a box of HNT with friend and fellow Overpit.ch contributor, Jack Lockwood, when suddenly the pack I am opening contains a mystery. I see that at the back of this pack resides a card, not a token. In my excitement I tear the rest of the paper away and place my bounty face-up on the table before me. A cold foil Blood Spattered Vest glints in the frigid, uncaring glow of the convention hall lighting. Selling at $185, this is easily one of the best pulls of the set, so why aren’t I happy about it? Not long after, Jack and I return to the booth to split another box only to find they’ve sold out. We paid 10% more at another vendor for the inconvenience, even though there had been a full case in stock when we bought the first. Out of this box, Jack hits his own pulls. A rainbow foil Shelter From the Storm (market price $83) and a Command and Conquer (market price $78).
 Maybe it was fate, maybe it was karma, but not 5 minutes before we deluded ourselves into this retail therapy, we were both commiserating over the brutal cost of commitment to FaB. As you will already know if you have read his Mario article, Jack’s financial engagement with Flesh and Blood had waned in the time since his initial commitment to Levia. He and I share the opinion that FaB asks too much of its players, and ultimately punishes those on the game’s fringes most. Simply put, it is not possible to keep up with Flesh and Blood and be on speaking terms with a financial advisor. 
According to data from FABREC, the average price of the ten most popular non-common staples is $105.20. Similarly, the average price of decks in the top 8 of Battle Hardened: Portland is $1070, with the average in the top 8 of Calling: Christchurch at $1316. Compare this to the $822 of the Modern 10k that same weekend at SCGCon, which drops to an average of $740 with the removal of 4 copies of Mox Opal from the total. While FaB has many issues, notably overt, extensive (often ridiculous) oversexualization of women and the prevalence of orientalism in hero design, for now at least I will keep my sights fixed on the atrocity that is FaB’s cost of entry (sorry, women). 
12 out of 16 heroes that comprised the two aforementioned top-8s were printed in the last year alone. Now I may not be the best equipped to speak on high level competitive events, but this is an obvious recency bias. Some of you may be thinking, “but Ethan! those are Mistveil heroes, and therefore do not count!” to which I say, “suck my dick, nerd.” To put it in terms you can understand, power creep was not just your nickname in high-school
I feel as though the failures of its competitor has allowed Flesh and Blood to exist in a relatively privileged position. Critique is met with resistance, and with the necessary investment as high as ever, the committed are placed in a lose-lose situation. They must either admit that change is necessary and lose out on potential resale value of the cards they overpaid for, or keep the prices prohibitively high, slowly suffocating interest from new players who will balk at the high costs. 
As someone with a foot in both worlds, the most common reason I have found among the Magic players who like the game but will not commit to playing it is the cost of entry. Maybe this is the result of FaB’s flagship format asking for an average investment of over $1000 up front, or maybe nothing is wrong and we don't need new players anyways.
I will consider this article a success if the response is
